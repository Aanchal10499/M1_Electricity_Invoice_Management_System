# Electricity Invoice management System

What: This project is used to manage Electricity bills of various customers and also 
     their monthly bills can also be displayed
    
Why: As the population increases the demand for Electricity is increasing with that there is a 
requirement for management system that manages and calculates the bill of all the customers

How: with the above problem in mind we have created a program using c programming and data types which generates the bill for units consumed by customers


## S.W.O.T.S

Strengths: It can keep bills of all customer for every month and calculate the bill just by the knowledge of units consumed

Weaknesses: Is not optimised for a large scale of customers

Opportunities: Can be used to generate invoice, cater to a larger section of consumers
